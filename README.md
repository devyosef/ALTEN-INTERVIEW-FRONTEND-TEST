# ALTEN SHOP FRONT

The `master` branch is up to date with the features I developed, as requested in the README file shared with me earlier.

All features and bonuses are developed in the `master` branch.

### Quick note on the "Add to Cart" functionality:

- **In the product list**, you need to adjust the quantity first and then click on the cart icon.
- **On the cart page**, just change the quantity of a product, and it will be updated directly. This includes the total price for the selected product and the overall total price.
